        <p>The best recipe for low-carb chocolate chip cookies that I found right out of college. I started baking these when I would get home late from a swing shift and needed a quick late-night treat.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Some of these can be replaced for others; instead of Splenda, you could use erythritol. Instead of Lily's chocolate chips, you can use extra dark chocolate chips (e.g., Ghiradeli 60% Cocoa Chips).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5–2 C almond flour (I used super fine, and did more like 2 cups for a thicker cookie)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp xanthan gum (this is a MUST)</li>
            <li>1 stick butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 C Splenda</li>
            <li>3/4 C Lilly’s chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>It's really tough to make these cookies with cold butter. I recommend setting the butter out to room temperature before combining with the Splenda.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180ºC (355ºF). Microwave the butter for 30 seconds to melt, but it shouldn't be hot.</li>
            <li>Place the butter into a mixing bowl and beat with the erythritol. Add the vanilla and egg, mix on low for another 15 seconds exactly.</li>
            <li>Add the almond flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Press the dough together and remove from the bowl. Combine the chocolate chips into the dough with your hands.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough (or use a small ice cream scoop) to Make 12 balls and place on a baking tray. Bake for 10 mins (or I did 20)</li>
            <li>Let them cool, and serve. Keep in an airtight container for up to 7 days.</li>
            <li>Okay so I baked mine at 15/20 min bc my oven sucks. I also broiled the tops for a more brown look, you don’t have to but they will be pretty soft, that’s why I added the extra almond flour.</li>
        </ol>
